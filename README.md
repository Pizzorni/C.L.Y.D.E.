# C.L.Y.D.E.

Final project for Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2015. Taught by Julian
Togelius at NYU Poly. Created by Whitney Mulhern and Giorgio Pizzorni.

## Part 1
Part 1 of the project will involve implementing every single algorithm
we learn in class.

In Pacman, Clyde is the shy orange ghost. He targets Pacman's tile if he is more than 8 blocks away. If he gets too close, he scurries away to his home corner. The current idea is to turn clyde into a killing machine by rewriting the other ghosts' AI so that they force pacman into Clyde's corner. Clyde will eventually get Pacman even though he doesn't want to.

Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.

We will make Clyde great.
