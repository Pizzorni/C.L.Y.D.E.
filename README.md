# C.L.Y.D.E.

Final project for Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2015. Taught by Julian
Togelius at NYU ~~Poly~~ Tandon. Created by Whitney Mulhern, Giorgio Pizzorni, and Kunal Relia.

## Part 1
Part 1 of the project will involve implementing every single algorithm
we learn in class.

We will have six initially identical populations. They will all receive a different combination of (variance, temperature change). Variance will be either mutation, reproduction, or both. Temperature chance will be increasing or decreasing.

We will use simulated annealing to modify the randomness of our evolutionary algorithms. Half of the algorithms will become more random as time progresses, the other half will become less random. Each set of algorithms will implement just mutation, just crossover, or both.

We will then perform some rudimentary statistical analysis on performance, but more interestingly, in how they evolve. How differently will they evolve? Will they evolve consistently through multiple trials? How will they evolve in response to different ghost controllers?
